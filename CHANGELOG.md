All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Release/distribution docs now spell out the current source-first install path and the tag-driven GitHub Release lane.

### Changed

- Installer now prefers local checkout installs, supports a git fallback, and finishes setup with a quiet incremental refresh plus compact summary output.
- MCP background refresh and `aicx_store` now use the real incremental rescan path (`aicx all --incremental --emit none`) instead of relying on a misleading stdout contract.
- `docs/COMMANDS.md` has been expanded to cover the active CLI surface and current stdout defaults.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **MCP server** (`aicx serve` / standalone `aicx-mcp` binary): 4 tools (search, rank, refs, store) over stdio and streamable HTTP transports.
- **Per-chunk quality scoring** (`rank.rs`): content-level signal/noise classification (0-10 scale) replacing the old all-SIGNAL output.
- `aicx rank` subcommand with `--strict` (hide noise) and `--top N` flags.
- **Dashboard search API**: `/api/search/fuzzy`, `/api/search/semantic`, `/api/search/cross` endpoints with rmcp-memex integration.
- `/api/health` and `/health` endpoints.
- Polish diacritics normalization for fuzzy search (wdrozenie matches wdrozenie).
- `project=` filter on fuzzy search (scopes to single project).
- Auto-rescan before search queries (incremental, milliseconds).
- Unified JSON error contract for all 400 responses.
- `aicx intents` subcommand for structured intent/decision extraction.

### Changed

- Rank made default command (`aicx -p proj` runs rank).
- Skills removed from repo — canonical source: VetCoders/vetcoders-skills.
- Package excludes: `*.html`, `*.patch`, `*.orig`, `.ai-agents/`, `skills/`.

### Added (Governance)

- LICENSE (MIT), CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, SECURITY.md.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow (ubuntu + macos-14).
- Issue templates (bug report, feature request).
- Cargo.toml: keywords, categories, homepage, excludes.

### Fixed
